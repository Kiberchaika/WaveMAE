# WaveMAE
Masked Autoencoder for waveform-based generative modeling.

## Overview
WaveMAE is a representation learning project that creates a rich representation for diffusion-based models for audio. 
It facilitates the alignment to pretrained Wa2Vec and Crepe models to enrich the latent space for better descriptiveness.
Vocoder-free design captures subtleties in sound.
